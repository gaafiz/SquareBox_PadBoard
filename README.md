# SquareBox PadBoard

Windows executable (.exe) in the dist folder of this repo ready to be downloaded and used.
> **NOTE:** the exe may be smaller but we didn't optimize the imported libraries yet.
> However, it's not a critical point at the moment as it is still a manageable 18MB-ish size

to rebuild the exe run:
`pyinstaller -F -w squarebox_padboard.py`
